## Introduction
With over 200 million users, MercadoLibre is the most popular e-commerce site in Latin America. The analysis notebook included evaluates how the company's Google Search traffic correlates to its stock price. Additionally, a Prophet forecast model is used to predict hourly user search traffic, as well as to forecast the companyâ€™s future revenue.

## Summary of Results
The main analysis findings are as follows:
1. The stock price only appears to correlate well (r=0.41) with the search traffic in 2020 after the beginning of the COVID shutdown, as shown below.

2. Attempts to find correlations between lagged traffic search (by 1 hr period), and stock volatility and returns were futile, as very low values of r were obtained.See below.
